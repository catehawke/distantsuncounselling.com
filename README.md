## What is it

A website for distantsuncounselling.com using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

The site content is written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) which is easier to write than html. The markdown files are located in the `site` folder.

## Developer notes

This project uses `git-lfs` for content images. If you're not the owner then you will not be able to authenticate for the large media service. When cloning the repo, make sure `git-lfs` is not installed in your local system.
