# Hello...

My name is Cate Hawke and I’m a relational integrative counsellor specialising in loss and life transitions working out of a practice in Central London. Like many of us this page is a work in progress but in the meantime feel free to get in touch if you’d like more information.

**Full website coming soon...**
